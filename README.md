# DMAC 2021 seminars

GitHub Actions (GHA) is a way to automate workflows. While you can write your own, usually we can find what we need already in the marketplace [1].

In this talk we will cover how to use GHA to:

1. Setup a conda environment for Python testing.
2. Setup a “pure” Python+pip environment for tests.
3. Build and publish documentation to gh-pages.
4. Build, test, and publish source distribution and binary artifacts to PyPI.
5. Build, test, cache, and publish docker image.
